Wordphoto

A small experiment done at the Processing Jam 2, Berlin May 2013
by Christiaan Janssen


Instructions
------------

In order to run the code you will need to install Processing and the Beads library (and, I guess, Java as well):
http://processing.org
http://www.beadsproject.net

Load the sketch which is located in the directory "wordphoto" of this repository and run it from processing.  The application reads the input from your microphone and generates visuals based on an analysis of that input.  Make sure that the sound settings of your system are properly configured.

Alternatively, I have generated executables for different platforms.  You will still need Java to run them, though.  You can find them in the "binaries" directory of the repository.

I would provide direct downloads but unfortunately it was decided to use Github during the jam.  Not my fault.
